Alison McCodichie - Homework 15 - Mapping  with Leaflet Challenge

The purpose of this project was to create an interactive map showcasing earthquakes around the world. Javascript and d3 were used to read in data and create multiple visual layers. Each earthquake is represented by a circle that varies in diameter depending on magnitude, and color depending on depth of earthquake. Users have the ability to click the circle markers and see details of that specific eathquake. A screenshot of the map is included in the submission folder.
